### Code Journal: When Working on this assignment I learned How to use Express I felt That it was a much easier process then using the http module. If I were to make a server on my own I would 100% use Express as it's the industry standard and is easier to work with in my opinion I thought using the try and catch block was easy to implement but I could not find a good spot to throw a new Error If I have any question it would be where I should put that block of code
